# Security Architecture

This document outlines the security architecture of the Emergency Duress App, focusing on data protection and OWASP Mobile Security compliance.

## Overview

The Emergency Duress App implements comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, following industry best practices and OWASP Mobile Security guidelines.

## OWASP Mobile Top 10 Implementation

### M1: Improper Credential Usage

- JWT-based authentication implemented
- Token validation with proper Authority and Audience checks
- Secure credential storage using expo-secure-store on mobile devices
- Role-based access control with custom claim types

### M2: Inadequate Supply Chain Security

- Automated dependency scanning with Dependabot
- Regular npm audit checks for JavaScript dependencies
- NuGet package vulnerability scanning for .NET components
- Weekly scheduled security scans

### M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization

- JWT token validation with proper configuration
- Role-based access control implementation
- Secure session management
- Authorization checks in API controllers

### M4: Insufficient Input/Output Validation

- Model validation in API controllers
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Error handling with proper logging

### M5: Insecure Communication

- HTTPS enforcement via UseHttpsRedirection
- TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features
- CORS policy configuration for allowed origins

### M6: Inadequate Privacy Controls

- Secure storage implementation using expo-secure-store
- Data minimization practices
- Proper error handling to prevent data leaks
- User consent management for data collection

### M7: Insufficient Binary Protections

- Code obfuscation in production builds
- Runtime integrity checks
- Anti-tampering mechanisms
- Secure key storage implementation

### M8: Security Misconfiguration

- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure default settings
- Regular security audits
- Configuration validation in CI/CD pipeline

### M9: Insecure Data Storage

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Secure local storage with expo-secure-store
- MongoDB with encryption at rest
- Proper key management

### M10: Insufficient Cryptography

- Industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Proper key generation and management
- Secure random number generation
- Regular cryptographic implementation reviews

## Data Protection

### Encryption in Transit

- TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- HTTPS enforcement across all environments
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features

### Encryption at Rest

- MongoDB encryption at rest for database storage
- expo-secure-store for mobile device storage
- Secure key management practices

## Implementation Details

### API Security

- HTTPS redirection enforced in Program.cs
- JWT authentication with proper configuration
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

### Mobile App Security

- Secure local storage via expo-secure-store
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Proper error handling to prevent data leaks
- Runtime integrity checks

### Database Security

- MongoDB encryption at rest
- Secure connection strings
- Proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Security Monitoring

- Regular security scans
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Access logging and audit trails
- Error tracking and monitoring

### Compliance Checks

- Regular security audits
- OWASP compliance verification
- Dependency updates
- Configuration validation
