# Security Practices

This document outlines the security measures and practices implemented in our CI/CD pipeline for the Emergency Duress App project.

## Security Scanning

### CodeQL Analysis

We use GitHub's CodeQL for automated code scanning:

```yaml
security-scan:
  name: Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
    security-events: write

  steps:
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: csharp

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

#### Scanned Languages

- C# (.NET API)
- TypeScript/JavaScript (Expo app)

#### Scan Schedule

- On every pull request
- On push to main branch
- Weekly scheduled scans

## Dependency Security

### Automated Scanning

1. **Dependabot Security Updates**

   - Automatic security update PRs
   - Real-time vulnerability alerts
   - Weekly dependency scans

2. **npm Audit (Expo App)**

   - Runs during CI pipeline
   - Checks for known vulnerabilities
   - Generates security reports

3. **NuGet Security Check (.NET)**
   - Package vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency graph analysis
   - Security advisory checks

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Secret Management

✅ Do:

- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use environment-specific secrets

❌ Don't:

- Commit secrets to repositories
- Share secrets in PR comments
- Store secrets in code comments

### 2. Code Security

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Implement proper authentication
- Use role-based access control
- Validate user permissions

#### Input Validation

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate request parameters
- Implement proper error handling

#### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use secure communication (HTTPS)
- Implement proper data access controls

### 3. Infrastructure Security

#### CI/CD Pipeline

- Minimal permission principle
- Isolated build environments
- Secure artifact storage

#### Deployment

- Secure deployment credentials
- Environment isolation
- Production safeguards

## Security Checks in CI

### Pull Request Checks

1. **Static Analysis**

   - Code quality
   - Security patterns
   - Known vulnerabilities

2. **Dependency Scanning**

   - Version verification
   - Security advisories
   - Compatibility checks

3. **Secrets Scanning**
   - Credential leaks
   - API key exposure
   - Token validation

### Continuous Monitoring

1. **Runtime Security**

   - Application monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Security logging

2. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Resource access logs
   - Network monitoring
   - Service health checks

## Security Response Process

### 1. Vulnerability Detection

When a security issue is detected:

1. Automatic alert generation
2. Security team notification
3. Impact assessment
4. Priority classification

### 2. Response Actions

Based on severity:

| Level    | Response Time | Action          |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Critical | Immediate     | Emergency patch |
| High     | 24 hours      | Prioritized fix |
| Medium   | 1 week        | Planned update  |
| Low      | Next sprint   | Regular release |

### 3. Remediation Process

1. Issue investigation
2. Fix development
3. Security testing
4. Emergency deployment (if needed)
5. Post-mortem analysis

## Compliance Requirements

### Code Standards

1. **Input Validation**

   ```csharp
   // Good
   public async Task<IActionResult> ProcessUser(UserDto userDto)
   {
       if (!ModelState.IsValid)
           return BadRequest(ModelState);
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   // Good
   try {
     await api.processData(data);
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error("Processing failed:", error);
     throw new ApplicationError("Processing failed", { cause: error });
   }
   ```

## Audit and Compliance

### Security Audits

Regular security audits include:

- Code review
- Dependency analysis
- Configuration assessment
- Access control review

### Compliance Checks

- Data protection standards
- Industry regulations
- Security certifications
- Best practices alignment

## Training and Documentation

### Developer Guidelines

1. Security awareness training
2. Secure coding practices
3. Vulnerability prevention
4. Incident response procedures

### Documentation Requirements

- Security implementations
- Configuration guides
- Incident response plans
- Compliance procedures

## Useful Commands

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Expo App
npm audit
npm audit fix

# .NET API
dotnet restore --force-evaluate
dotnet list package --vulnerable
```

### Secret Management

```bash
# GitHub CLI
gh secret set PROD_API_KEY
gh secret list
```
